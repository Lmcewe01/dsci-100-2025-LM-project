    "In the Computer Science Department at UBC, Dr. Frank Wood opened a Minecraft server to examine how people play videos games. Minecraft is a popular video game, developped in 2009, that allows players to explore, build, and create in a randomly-generated terrain made of voxels. From this server, two datasets have been generated, including the one used in this project: players.csv. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this final project, we would like to know which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that others can target those players in their recruiting efforts. Specifically, I want to know: *can we predict minecraft playing time based on age using the 'players.csv' dataset?* This may help server managers to know which age groups to target to obtain the most data (operationalized through hours played). \n",

This may limit the model's ability to predict at extremes, as the KNN model starts to grab the same data points over and over.

In this case, a different model (such as clustering) might be useful to capture each subgroup, making the model more specific and accurate."
